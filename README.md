# Email Spam Detection using Python & Machine Learning

This is a simple spam detector project built using Python, scikit-learn, and natural language processing. The model classifies messages as either "spam" or "ham" using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `spam_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Use `predict_message("your text")` to test your own input.

## 📊 Accuracy
The model achieves around 97–98% accuracy on the test set.
